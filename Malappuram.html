    <p align="justify">Malappuram is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala, with a coastline of 70 km (43 mi). It is the most populous district of Kerala, which is home to around 13% of the total population of the state.[13] The district was formed on 16 June 1969, spanning an area of about 3,554 km2 (1,372 sq mi). It is the third-largest district of Kerala by area, as well as the largest district in the state bounded by Western Ghats and Arabian Sea to the two sides. Malappuram is the third major contributing district to the Gross State Domestic Product of Kerala as of 2019, after Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram.[14]

        The district is divided into seven Taluks - Eranad, Kondotty, Nilambur, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Tirur, and Tirurangadi. Malappuram, Manjeri, Perinthalmanna, Kottakkal, Tirur, Kondotty, Chemmad, Puthanathani, Valanchery, and Edappal, are some of the economically booming towns in Malappuram district.
        
        Malayalam is the most spoken language. The district has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community.[15] Malappuram was the first e-literate as well as the first cyber literate district of India.[16][17] Malappuram metropolitan area is the fourth largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi, Calicut, and Thrissur urban areas and the 25th largest in India with a total population of 1.7 million.[18] 44.2% of the district's population reside in the urban areas according to the 2011 census of India.
        
        Three of Kerala's six longest rivers, Chaliyar, Kadalundi River, and Bharathappuzha, flow through the district. The port town of Ponnani was one of the major ports in the Malabar Coast during the medieval period.[19] During the early medieval period, the district was home to two of the four major kingdoms that ruled Kerala. Perumpadappu was the hometown of the Kingdom of Cochin, which is also known as Perumbadappu Swaroopam, and Nediyiruppu was the hometown of the Zamorin of Calicut, which is also known as Nediyiruppu Swaroopam. During the colonial era, Malappuram became the headquarters of European and British troops and it later became the headquarters of the Malabar Special Police (M.S.P) formerly known as Malappuram Special Force formed in 1885.[20] The modern Malayalam literature as well as the Arabi Malayalam script took their shape on the bank of Bharathappuzha river and Tirur River in the Taluks of Ponnani and Tirur.</p>
